# SKILL: scope-lock-prd-lite
Goal: Turn a vague feature idea into a "scope-locked PRD-lite" that engineers can execute without ambiguity.

## Output must include
- MVP vs Later
- Clear user journeys
- Acceptance criteria that can be tested
- Key constraints: stack, local dev, infra, security

- [ ] Roles/permissions described if any
- [ ] Error and empty states considered

### Engineering Readiness

- [ ] Data model draft included
- [ ] NFRs included (perf/security/observability)

## Required output section
- MVP / Later

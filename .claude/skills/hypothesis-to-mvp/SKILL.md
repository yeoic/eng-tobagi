# SKILL: hypothesis-to-mvp
Goal: Convert a raw idea into a hypothesis-driven MVP with clear metrics and an experiment plan.

## Checklist
### Problem clarity
- [ ] Identify the trigger moment (when user feels pain)
- [ ] Identify the existing workaround and why it fails
- [ ] Define the smallest user-visible win

### Hypothesis
- [ ] Write at least 1 falsifiable hypothesis (H1)
- [ ] Define what would prove it wrong

### MVP scope
- [ ] Must-have list is short (ship in 1–2 iterations)
- [ ] Explicit "not MVP" list exists

### Metrics
- [ ] 1 North Star + 1–2 leading indicators
- [ ] Guardrails (e.g., churn, error rate, spam)
- [ ] Define required events (names + properties)

### Experiment
- [ ] Define rollout stages (beta -> full)
- [ ] Define success thresholds

## Output Required
- Hypothesis (H1)
- MVP (must-have / not MVP)
- Metrics (north star/leading/guardrails)
- Experiment plan
- Analytics event list
